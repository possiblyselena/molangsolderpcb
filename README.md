# molangsolderpcb
This is a PCB design I made for the Solder YSWS! I used KiCad to design the schematic, PCB, and making the bitmaps for the silkscreen drawings. For this PCB specifically I made a Molang themed keychain with LEDs that light up when you press the button on the side.

Materials:
3x 5mm LEDs 
3x 220om Resistors
1x 6mm Push Button
1x CR2032 Battery Cell
1x Custom PCB
