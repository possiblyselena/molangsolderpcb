# Molang Solder PCB
This is a PCB design I made for the Solder YSWS! I used KiCad to design the schematic, PCB, and making the bitmaps for the silkscreen drawings. For this PCB specifically I made a Molang themed keychain with LEDs that light up when you press the button on the side. Additionally, there's a potentiometer on the back so you can adjust the brightness of the LEDS!

**Materials**
- 3x 5mm LEDs 
- 3x 220om Resistors
- 1x 6mm Push Button
- 1x Potentiometer
- 3x 2N3904 Transistos
- 1x CR2032 Battery Cell
- 1x Custom PCB
